### Tuts+ Course: Build a Polling App With Rails
**Instructor: José Mota**

This course is an exercise that focuses on how to build a polling application from scratch with Ruby on Rails. You'll learn how to dissect a complex data model into several parts and also how to extract meaningful data from the information gathered. You'll then create beautiful visual displays of the data with JavaScript using the Google Charts library. Our application will also use simple Bootstrap styling, aspects of test-driven development and user autentication.
